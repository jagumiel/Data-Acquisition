# Data Acquisition on LabVIEW
## _LabVIEW projects_

First of all... I am not an expert on LabVIEW, I have just used it in a couple of subjects at the university and I have done some fast projects with it, but I just know the basics. Under this folder I am sharing some work done in LabVIEW. Hope you find it interesting!

## Folder Structure

    .
    ├── car_simulation          # Contains full LabVIEW project and instructions.
    ├── temp_reader             # Contains full LabVIEW project and instructions.
    └── README.md               # Readme.md file

## Projects' Briefing
Right now there are two projects: Car simulation and temp reader.

- **Temperature reader:** This project was done to test the *LabVIEW Interface for Arduino Toolkit*. I just wanted to comprobate if I could read data from a temperature sensor through LabVIEW using an Arduino platform. Thanks to this project, I decided to do the _car simulation_.

- **Car Simulation:** This project was for an assignment at university. Our teacher asked us to make a small project using LabVIEW. As I had an Arduino and some sensors at home, I decided to simulate some automotive systems. I used a temperature sensor and a photoresistor in order to simulate the climatizer and the automatic lighting functions. If you need more details, you can find a readme.md under this project, or you can also check [this blog entry (in Spanish).](https://jagumiel.xyz/blog/2018/04/10/simulacion-de-automatismos-en-labview/)

### Need more information
If you enter in the project's folder, you can find its' own _readme_ file.

## Instructions
The projects have their own "vi" files. Just open them with LabVIEW and start the compilation. You also will need some hardware or electronic components.
