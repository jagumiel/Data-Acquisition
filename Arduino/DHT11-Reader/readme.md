# Temperature and Humidity Reader (DHT11)
## _Prints the ambient temperature and relative humidity on console_

This project is an easy one. It just reads the data from a DHT11 sensor and prints it on the console via UART.
For this project, I have used the DHT11.h library and the sensor has been connected to the pin  of an Arduino Uno board.


## Instructions
Clone the repository, open the .ino file with the Arduino IDE and program it into the development board.
Connect the sensor to the digital pin 7 and feed it with 3.3V.
